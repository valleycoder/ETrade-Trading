ETrade Equity trading bot. 

Please read the Instructions.txt file for details. This is important.

Please read the code and try to understand the approach.

Please use the script at your own risk. If you don't know python and if you can't read python code then maybe it's a good idea to skip this repository. The main reason I am cautioning is because this involves direct money and if you give wrong inputs things may go wrong. I have tested it. I know I should have added more validations.

Best approach is to try this script by loading your ETrade account with $2000 and trade with 2-3 stocks for 5-6 months. You can use your ETrade account for other manual trades, just make sure that stock SYMBOL's used for manual trades are different from the one's used by this script.

I can set this up on your machine for USD 25. You can reach me at etradebot101@gmail.com
 
Thank you.
